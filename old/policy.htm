  <span class="apple-style-span"><b>Player Maximum.</b></span> Our policy is to 
  try to accommodate all players arriving and signing up for the Round Robin in 
  time, no matter how many we are.&nbsp; The process of assigning players to 
  groups and tables is often complicated but we have a good computer program to 
  facilitate it. This process has two goals: The first is to have everyone 
  assigned to groups where the other players are of the same level. With 
  exception for the table winner promotion rule (see #4 below) this arrangement 
  is made in accordance with the current club rating. With newcomers, it is of 
  course more complicated, but our policy is to rather have them climb than 
  descend our club rating (i.e. rather giving a too low, than a too high initial 
  rating). The second goal is to get started as soon as possible, once the 
  sign-up deadline has passed.&nbsp; The ideal group size is 6 players, with no 
  less than 2 tables (3 players/table). At the moment (and for the foreseeable 
  future) we have 20 tables at our disposal. As soon as we are more than 60 
  players we have to &quot;squeeze in&quot; more than 3 players on average per table. No 
  exact scheme for how this should ideally be made (given different numbers of 
  players) has yet been drawn up, but we try to be as fair as possible with the 
  goal that everyone should be able to finish approximately the same number of 
  matches (ideally at least 4). A slight preference, however, is given to the 
  highest rated table(s) in order to attract skilled players (which everyone can 
  enjoy watching) to the club.&nbsp;

  <span class="apple-style-span"><b><span style="color: black">Promotion of 
  table winners to next level. </span></b></span>
  <p>The Round Robin groups are each Friday created strictly according to the 
  current ratings, except for the principle of table winner promotion. This 
  principle means that the player who won his/her respective table (marked by 
  red color on the result sheet) is guaranteed the right to play on the next 
  higher table the directly following week, unless he/she is rated more than 200 
  points below the person who would be downgraded (moved down one table) because 
  of this promotion.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt">
  <b>Ratings system.</b>
  <p>a) The basic rating formula calculates the rating outcome of each 
  individual match and awards 16 points to a 3-0 winner over an equally rated 
  opponent. If the players in a match do not have equal rating (the usual case), 
  these 16 points are modified, up or down, with 4% of the rating difference 
  between the involved players. This means, for example, that a player rated 400 
  points or more above his opponent gains 0 point for a 3-0 victory (4% of 400 
  is 16). In addition, individual games won by the loser in a match count for 2 
  points each, i.e. if the same player as in the example above beats his/her 
  opponent (rated 400 points or more below) with 3-2, he/she will in fact lose 4 
  points. These individual rating outcomes for each match are shown on the 
  result sheet in the “Rating change vs.” section. (Note that all rating changes 
  for players rated 2000 or above are cut in half, in order to make it more 
  difficult for the highest rated players to earn bonus points).</p>
  <p>b) Bonus points. Players who during one Friday night gain more than 24 
  rating points are awarded with bonus points according to the simple principle 
  that all gained points above 24 count twice. If the sum of someone’s rating 
  changes from all his/her individual matches, for example, is 30 he will in 
  fact receive 36 points. These bonus points are awarded as a measure to counter 
  the built-in deflation (due to the fact that players improve over time) in the 
  system. The implication of this bonus system is that it is a good idea, if you 
  want to improve your rating fast, not only to beat better rated players, but 
  also to try to win as many matches as possible in one evening. <br>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt"><b>Default if leaving 
	early.</b> Players who leave the tournament before 9:35 (independent of the 
  reason) 
  will default their remaining matches (if any), given that the opponent wish to play, and the opponent will be given 
  a rating credit of 10 points. Such default matches should be marked on the 
  score sheet with a &quot;3&quot; for the winner and &quot;def&quot; for the loser (the one who 
  left). After 9:35, match score involving a player who leaves early will be 
  0-0.<span style="color: red">
  </span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt"><b>Manual rating 
	adjustments.</b> Subjective rating adjustments are often conducted for new 
  players (approx. the 1-3 first times they play at our club) in order to reduce 
  the impact on our collective rating caused by the subjectively assigned and 
  often misleading initial ratings. If you are a new player, or for some other 
  reason, feel that your rating is very misleading, feel free to notify us 
  (directly on a Friday night or by personal email) and we will consider an 
  adjustment. We won’t, however, adjust anyone’s rating without a good reason. 
  Newcomers who have a USATT rating should normally use it the first time they 
  play at our club.</li>
