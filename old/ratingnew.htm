<p><font size="6">Rating system</font></p>
<p>In the Berkeley Table Tennis Club we use our own rating system, created by 
one of our players Mike Labins. This enables us to assign players to suitable 
Round Robin groups each Friday according to their table tennis skills. </p>
<p>The system is relatively simple...each match is worth 16 pts plus or minus 4% 
of the rating difference. The winner always wins at least 2pts if he wins 3-0,
the loser of the match receives 2 points for each game they win. For example an 
1100 beats a 700 (400 pts difference) 3-2. The 1100 gets two pts for the
match win, but ends up losing two pts net because of the game score. Bonus 
points are awarded when one wins more than 24 points in one tourney; all points 
above 24 count double for one complete tourney result. For example (and 
I'm rounding the results for simplicity) an 1100 losing to an 1179
0-3, loss of two pts, lost to 800 2-3 (50 pts higher loss 14 pts on match, but a 
net loss only 10pts&nbsp;because of game score) loss to 791 almost the same
idea loss of 12 pts net...win over 1100 3-0 (350 over so 16 pts plus 4%=30 pts 
net)and I think you won&nbsp; one game for an extra two pts ,sounds like your
net gain of 8 points.....&nbsp;&nbsp; The system is modified when you reach 
2000...... </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">To those interested why this rating system was developed…<O:P></O:P></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The previous system in place for many years at the BTTC 
created stagnant ratings…ratings were deflated and advancement was unlikely and 
difficult in my observation. Also errors and omission in the old program could 
not be altered.<O:P></O:P></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of course using the USTTA rating system was discussed but 
it involves constant fees and subsequently was decided not to use it but create 
a reasonable program which would be cost effective and accurate. I personally 
adapted the united states chess federation rating system program for table 
tennis incorporating for the first time not only match wins but the degree of 
the match win…the match score. I feel it works fine for our club and &nbsp;some 
adjustments have been made to fine tune it somewhat. Perhaps further adjustments 
may be needed ,,,time will tell</p>

<p><b><font size="5">Ratings Changes for Players over 2000</font></b></p>
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>This announcement only affects your rating if you are above 2000, the&nbsp; 
current new rating system which has circumvented deflation (of ratings) in the 
lower sections with bonus points has caused inflation in the top sections.</p>
<p>To solve this problem we've taken two steps:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; All ratings above 2050 will be reduced on a one time basis by 25% of the 
points above 2050 , for example Player A is 2300 (2300 - 2050 = 250 - 25% = 62.5 
pts) - Player B is 2150 (2150 - 2050 =100 - 25% = 25 pts)</p>
<p>&nbsp;2.&nbsp; After this adjustment ratings will be newly calculated at half the 
original formula, but the bonus point threshold will remain at 24 points, the 
end result will be the equivalent of doubling the bonus point threshold, making 
it much more difficult to gain bonus points&nbsp; and creating much smaller swings in 
the actual rating.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope these steps are satisfactory and any observations and 
comments will be appreciated.</p>
