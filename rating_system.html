  <h1>Rating System</h1>
  <p>
    In the Berkeley Table Tennis Club we use our own rating system. The system was created by one of our players,
    Mike Labins, in order for us to be able to assign players to suitable round robin groups each Friday
    according to their table tennis skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    The system is relatively simple: Each match is worth 16 points, plus or minus 4% of the initial ranking
    difference between the players. The winner always wins at least 2 points. The loser of the match receives 2
    points for each game he wins, and those points are subtracted from the winner's 16 points. Here are some
    examples:
  </p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Player Ranking</th>
        <th>Games Won</th>
        <th>Games Lost</th>
        <th>Ranking Points Difference</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1100</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>-16</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>700</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>+16</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>
    For example, if a player ranked 1100 beats a player ranked 700 with a match score of 3 games to 2, the
    player ranked 1100 gets 2 points for the match win but ends up losing 2 points because of the game score
    (16 points for the win minus 16 points for the ranking difference, but a win is always worth at least 2
    points).
  </p>
  <!--
  <p>
    Bonus points are awarded when a player wins more than 24 points in one tournament. All points above 24 count
    double for one complete tournament result. In this case (and I'm rounded the results for simplicity) losing
    to a 1179 0-3 means a loss of two points, lost to 800 2-3 (50 pts higher loss 14 pts on match but a net loss only 10pts because of game score) loss to 791 almost the same
    idea loss of 12 pts net...win over 1100 3-0 (350 over so 16 pts plus 4%=30 pts net) and I think you won  one game for an extra two pts ,sounds like your
    net gain of 8 points.   The system is modified when you reach 2000.

  <h3>UPDATE JAN 17 2025</h3>
  <br>
  <p>
    We regularly adjust our club’s ratings so they stay in line with official USATT ratings. To do this, we compare our members’ club ratings with their USATT ratings and see if there’s any inflation (when our ratings are consistently higher). If the data shows we’re, say, 7% higher than the USATT scale, we reduce everyone’s score by that same 7%. This keeps everyone’s relative standing the same—nobody jumps ahead or falls behind compared to others—while bringing our overall ratings closer to the official USATT levels. We also make sure no score goes below 100, so there’s always a minimum.
  </p>

    <b>This year we reduced everyone's rating by 7%</b>
