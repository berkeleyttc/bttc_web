							</p>									
							<p>
								<b> [03/17/2022]</b>: Due to a technical hiccup with the recreation facility, BTTC needs to postpone the re-opening of the Round-Robin play to  
								 04/01/202.					
								Therefore, there will be no RR tomorrow night (03/18/2022). We apologize for any inconvenience it brings. 
							</p>								
							<p>
								<td>[03/12/2022]</td>: Upon consulting with the City of Berkeley, BTTC has decided to resume our Friday Round-Robin play starting from 
								 03/18/2022.

                                The BTTC Board would like to draw your attention to the first confirmed case of coronavirus infection in the Bay Area
                                on Jan. 31, 2020 and the potential implications for us as a group.  We would advise that anyone who has recently returned from China
                                is strongly urged to wait for at least <span class="auto-style1"><strong> 14 days </strong></span> before joining us in the Friday RRs and Saturday group training.  
                                The 14-day window is important because the typical incubation period for the coronavirus is 14 days from the date a person is infected.
                                But cases have shown patients who have been infected can transmit the virus to others even before he or she becomes symptomatic.
                                We don't want to turn players away but we understand the seriousness of the matter and utimately this is for protecting the well being of all of us.
                                Thanks for your understanding and coorporation!

								[Before 03/16/2020]: 
                              </td>							
								Note that we'll open on Fridays at 6:15 PM for warm-up. Round robins will start shortly after
								7:00 PM. Saturday night group training/open play sessions are between 7:00 PM and 9:00 PM.
								See you all at the gym!
							</p>
							<p>
								Starting August 18th, our fees for Friday RR and Sat Open play will change to $8 for adults and $5 for juniors (16 and under) and seniors. These changes are to accommodate for increased facilities costs.
