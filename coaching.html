          <h2>Coaching Program History</h2>
          <p>
            Coach Bunny first established the <acronym title="Berkeley Table Tennis Club">BTTC</acronym> coaching program in the
            summer of 2007. They started training in a small common room on the second floor of the James Kenney Community
            Center with only 8 students and 4 tables. As the number of students increased, they moved to the gym in 2009.

          <h2>About Bunny</h2>
          <p>
            Coach Bunny was born in Hong Kong, China and came to the United States as an immigrant with his
            family. He started playing table tennis when he was 13, which was considered quite late. He was selected
            to be in his high school table tennis team, but without parental support, could not play competitively.
            Coach Lee used to play penhold with short pips on one side, but now plays shakehand with inverted rubber
            on both sides.
          </p>
          <p>
            During his time playing Table Tennis, Coach Bunny has achieved several awards:
