        <h1>In Memory of Gil F. Ben</h1>
        <p>Guillermo (Gil) F. Ben passed away on June 18, 2024, at 18:05 due to a hemorrhagic stroke. Gil was 73 years old and is survived by his five children and seven grandchildren. He enjoyed playing the piano, going fishing on his boat with his friends, and was an avid table tennis player (known as ping-pong in Filipino). During family gatherings, Gil would often leave early, citing a tournament he needed to attend. He was a humble and generous person, always maintaining a positive outlook on life. Now, he is home with our Almighty God. Rest in peace, Gil.</p>
