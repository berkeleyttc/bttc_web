                <p><strong>If you already have an online account:</strong></p>

              answer: `
                <p>If you see a "No player found" message, your phone number isn't linked to an online account yet.</p>

                <p><strong>For returning BTTC players (you've played before):</strong></p>
                <div class="faq-highlight">
                  <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Go to the <a href="../signup/" class="faq-link">Sign Up page</a> to activate your online account. This is a one-time process that links your phone number to your existing player record.</p>
