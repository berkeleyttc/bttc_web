          <summary class="faq-question">I don't have an online account / "No player found" error</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">

            <div class="faq-highlight">
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Go to the <a href="../signup/" class="faq-link">Sign Up page</a> and select "Returning Player". Search for your name or BTTC ID, then complete your account activation by adding your phone number and email. This is a one-time process that links your phone number to your existing player record.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>For brand new BTTC members (never played before):</strong></p>
            <div class="faq-highlight">
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Go to the <a href="../signup/" class="faq-link">Sign Up page</a> and select "New Player".
